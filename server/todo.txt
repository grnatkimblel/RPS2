Netcode Techniques:
 - Client Side Interpolation
    - Client will interpolate between its previous and latest position data when it receives a gamestate
 - Client Side Reconciliation
    - Client will allow the user to retain the client players position provided the incoming gamestate is consistent with the clients past. If not, reconciliation, 
      where the clients inputs are recorded and re-simulated starting from the latest received gamestate, is performed to re-synchronize the client with the server
 - Client Side Prediction
    - This replaces client side interpolation.
    - Client displays other players positions updating without gamestate directive, instead predicting the other clients will continue their previous behavior. 
      They too will be subject to reconciliation in the case that the latest gamestate is not consistent.


Client needs to accept gamestate function and initial gamestate as delivered by server.

Packets should have unique identifiers assigned to them before they are sent. When the server updates the gamestate, 
all packets that were processed have their ids put into a list and sent back with the gamestate
Clients can check the received gamestate to see what of their sent packets have been acknowledged. This allows for reconciliation.

reconsiliation just doesnt actually work yet
also the socketio admin UI is showing that the sockets are transmitting kilobytes of data over a couple seconds of continuous input, need to shrink this acknowledgedPacketIds
