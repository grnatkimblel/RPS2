Netcode Techniques:
 - Client Side Interpolation
    - Client will interpolate between its previous and latest position data when it receives a gamestate
 - Client Side Reconciliation
    - Client will allow the user to retain the client players position provided the incoming gamestate is consistent with the clients past. If not, reconciliation, 
      where the clients inputs are recorded and re-simulated starting from the latest received gamestate, is performed to re-synchronize the client with the server
 - Client Side Prediction
    - This replaces client side interpolation.
    - Client displays other players positions updating without gamestate directive, instead predicting the other clients will continue their previous behavior. 
      They too will be subject to reconciliation in the case that the latest gamestate is not consistent.
