players can play hands after playing too early instead of being locked out for the round.
make it so when a player plays to early, the other player is awarded and the round skips, no need to have them play through.
maybe swtich the purple point and normal point scoring, its much harder to win the rps than to win the draw.
scoring is fucked up, purple point timeleft is overwritten and so gets fucked up.
