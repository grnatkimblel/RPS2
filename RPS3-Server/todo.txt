Netcode Techniques:
 - Client Side Interpolation
    - Client will interpolate between its previous and latest position data when it receives a gamestate
 - Client Side Reconciliation
    - Client will allow the user to retain the client players position provided the incoming gamestate is consistent with the clients past. If not, reconciliation, 
      where the clients inputs are recorded and re-simulated starting from the latest received gamestate, is performed to re-synchronize the client with the server
 - Client Side Prediction
    - This replaces client side interpolation.
    - Client displays other players positions updating without gamestate directive, instead predicting the other clients will continue their previous behavior. 
      They too will be subject to reconciliation in the case that the latest gamestate is not consistent.


also the socketio admin UI is showing that the sockets are transmitting kilobytes of data over a couple seconds of continuous input, need to shrink this acknowledgedPacketIds

Handle player death and respawn
Handle displaying game time
Handle game ending conditions

Include a short timeout after the min number is reached to allow more players for a larger roster

Quickdraw is broken, some users inputs are counting for both players, this is happening from
quicklog so may need to check against the normal flow
cbm is being scored to the player who plays last, like the exact opposite of what i want lol

the player who leaves a quickdraw arena never disconnects from their socket. There may need to be some delay or callback/api for this.

styling is so asssssss
