TODO:
Determine where to store refresh tokens so page reloads don't lose them and make them un-deletable
Determine if refresh tokens should have an expiration, requiring another login.
    If so, implement relogging in the background so as not to interrupt games.

Prevent duplicate refresh token creation, a player can only log in once.

Add the gamemode as a request parameter to the matchmaking service so the same component can service all gamemodes.
Update checkInvites to only show invites in the same gamemode.
